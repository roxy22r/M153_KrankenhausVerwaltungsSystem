There is a scirpt that create the tabel and another to add Data about Hostpital, Person, Patient, Employee, Disease, Medicine and the DiseaseHistory.


In this Project you will find min 2 Procedures and 2 Functions that may make the use of the DB easier.

## Why did our Team choose a 'Hospital Management System'

We choose the HospitalManagementSystem as a project because there is a lot of potential for a
TSQL Project. In a HospitalManagementSystem, there can be a lot of connections to diffrent Data.

## Tests

As discussed we made for both the 2 Procedures and the 2 Functions but not for the additional Functions/Procedures
